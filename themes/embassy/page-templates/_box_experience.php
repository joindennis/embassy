<hr class="line_experience" />

 <p>The Embassy Grand is owned and operated by the LaViola Family, a family that has been in the banquet and catering industry for well over 40 years. It began originally with Adriano LaViola’s mother & uncle in the 1970’s. During that time La Luna Banquet Hall opened and began doing weddings and social events for the Italian community. Adriano’s children adopted his passion for the industry and became thoroughbreds
 themselves having been raised in the industry. They watched their father run one of the most successful banquet facilities in the GTA until it was sold it in the 90’s. They aspired to continue he’s legacy and create a new place of their own. Embassy Grand convention center has allowed them to continue in their fathers steps.</p>
